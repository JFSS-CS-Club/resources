# Text Editors

Text editors are lightweight tools for quickly editing code. They're more lightweight than **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)** as they only have syntax highlighting to quickly edit code with and do not things such as compilers.

There are many popular text editors to pick from. Popular ones include: 

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

We will be going over the installation of VSCode in this guide as it is the most popular text editor to date and has support for a wide range of plugins.
